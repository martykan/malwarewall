## Installation

Ubuntu 20.04 is the main development platform and the only platform tested, however, the project should work on any Linux distribution.

The project is written in Rust, so the Rust toolchain needs to be installed. 

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Docker is also necessary to run honeypots. 

```
sudo apt install docker.io
```

Optional dependencies: 
- To inspect HTTPS traffic, you will need to install mitmproxy from [their website](https://mitmproxy.org/) and add it to PATH.
-
